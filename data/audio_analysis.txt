Example: -23.053
loudness_max
number
The peak loudness of the segment in decibels (dB). Combined with loudness_start and loudness_max_time, these components can be used to describe the "attack" of the segment.

Example: -14.25
loudness_max_time
number
The segment-relative offset of the segment peak loudness in seconds. Combined with loudness_start and loudness_max, these components can be used to desctibe the "attack" of the segment.

loudness_end
number
The offset loudness of the segment in decibels (dB). This value should be equivalent to the loudness_start of the following segment.

Example: 0

pitches
array of numbers
Pitch content is given by a “chroma” vector, corresponding to the 12 pitch classes C, C#, D to B, with values ranging from 0 to 1 that describe the relative dominance of every pitch in the chromatic scale. For example a C Major chord would likely be represented by large values of C, E and G (i.e. classes 0, 4, and 7).

Vectors are normalized to 1 by their strongest dimension, therefore noisy sounds are likely represented by values that are all close to 1, while pure tones are described by one value at 1 (the pitch) and others near 0. As can be seen below, the 12 vector indices are a combination of low-power spectrum values at their respective pitch frequencies.
